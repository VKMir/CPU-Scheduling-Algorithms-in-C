# CPU-Scheduling-Algorithms-in-C

Overview

This repository contains my own implementations of classic CPU Scheduling Algorithms written in C from scratch.
These algorithms simulate process scheduling in Operating Systems and calculate important metrics like:

Completion Time (CT)

Turnaround Time (TAT)

Waiting Time (WT)

Response Time (RT)

Average TAT & Average WT

⚡ Implemented Algorithms

First Come First Serve (FCFS)

Shortest Job First (SJF) – Non-Preemptive

Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) – Preemptive

Priority Scheduling (Preemptive & Non-Preemptive)

Round Robin (RR)

🛠️ How to Run

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>


Compile any algorithm using gcc:

gcc fcfs.c -o fcfs
./fcfs


(replace fcfs.c with the file you want to run)
